# Customer Behavior Analytics Using R

# Description: 
This project involves the analysis of customer purchasing behavior using a dataset that includes monetary value, recency, frequency of purchases, and other variables. The focus is on cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing the data to derive insights about customer segmentation and purchasing trends. The analysis makes use of the dplyr and tidyr packages in R for data manipulation and cleaning, alongside various visualization techniques.

# Key Features:
Data Cleaning & Imputation: Managed missing values and outliers in numeric variables such as monetary value, recency, and frequency using R's dplyr and tidyr functions.
RFM Segmentation: Created customer segments based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis, leveraging quantile-based classification and custom logic for factor conversion.
Visualizations: Produced histograms and bar plots to visualize purchase patterns and customer behavior, including monetary value per visit by gender, as well as other exploratory data visualizations.
Custom Functions: Developed a custom function for calculating key statistics (mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis) for numeric variables to better understand the distribution of customer data.
